Hello, this is a small textual guide on how to use Prolid.
=============================================================
First of all, if you do not know Python you can still use it but knowing how to code and the 
specific syntaxy of Python will be helpful especially if you want more customisation. 
With that out of the way, you need to have Python installed on your computer and 
simply run "main.py". This will run the program as is, but if you want to customise 
your maps further then the information below will be valuable to you

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Customisation
The easiest way to customise the generated map is to change the contents of "custom.py" 
if the only changes you want are for the names or colours to change then you only have to
edit this file and modify color_map from "biome.py". In custom.py you can decide which elements
 you want to change by mapping the default element to whatever you want inside the "changes" dictionary
 and you also have to add that desired element to color_map and assign it the colour you prefer.
 Finally, you just have to uncomment the applyChanges function and the third seeMap in "main.py"
 (Currently, applyChanges turns everything white except for rivers to visualise them closely)

 // Further customisation
 biomeMap, biomeMapEnhance, biomeMapAdd, biomeMapDry, biomeMapEnhance2 can all be modified by changing
 the arguments they take, more prob_island means it is more likely for a sea tile to turn into land, 
 a higher prob_flood means land tiles are more likely to become sea tiles, prob_island_surge is the 
 probability of a sea tile turning into land when it is surrounded by sea tiles. The iterations on
 biomeMapSmooth determines the number of smoothing operations to perform.
 Additionally, inside both biomeMapZone and biomeMapZone1, there are certain probability values you can 
 change however you like in case you want a certain zone to be more or less present in the final map.
 The code is well-commented so if you want to further modify it reading the code will be enough to 
 understand it.
